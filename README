                              Building JLDAP

JLDAP is built using a system developed by jakarta.apache.org called ANT.

The build files are all named "build.xml" and are found in key directories.

To set up your environment for ANT, do the following:

For Win32
    Assuming this source directory on win32 is d:/jldap, and java is installed
    in d:/jdk1.2.2, then you set in your environment:

        set JAVA_HOME=d:\jdk1.2.2
        set ANT_HOME=d:\jldap/ant
        PATH %ANT_HOME%\bin;%PATH%

    for Linux running shell with this source directory in /usr/home/jldap
    and java is installed in /local/jdk1.2.2 then:
        ANT_HOME=$PWD/jldap/ant
        JAVA_HOME=/local/jdk1.2.2
        PATH=".:$ANT_HOME/bin:$PATH"
        export ANT_HOME JAVA_HOME PATH

To build everything just invoke ant as follows:

    ant all

               subbordinate directories                                  
     cleanpkg- Cleans pkg directory                                      
     doc     - Builds javadoc files                                      
               Not available at the lowest directory level               
     debug   - Builds debug classes and jar files                        
               At the lowest level directory it only compiles java files.
     release - Builds release classes and jar files                      
               At the lowest level directory it only compiles java files.
     lib     - Builds debug & release classes and jar files.             
               At the lowest level directory it only compiles java files.
     jar     - Synonym for lib                                           
     all     - Builds everything possible.  At the top directory level it
               builds all, doc, & install.  At one directory level below  
               the top it builds all, & doc. At the lowest directory     
               level it compiles java files for release and debug.       
     install - Copies build results from all directories and creates the 
               pkg directory.  Only available in top makefile            
     pkt     - Synonym for pkg
