                              Building JLDAP

JLDAP is built using a system developed by jakarta.apache.org called ANT.

The build files are all named "build.xml" and are found in key directories.

To set up your environment for ANT, do the following:

For Win32
    Assuming this source directory on win32 is d:/jldap, and java is installed
    in d:/jdk1.2.2, then you set in your environment:

        set JAVA_HOME=d:\jdk1.2.2
        set ANT_HOME=d:\jldap\ant
        PATH %ANT_HOME%\bin;%PATH%

For Linux / Unix
    If Linux running bourne shell, and this source directory is located
    in /usr/home/jldap, and if java is installed in /usr/local/jdk1.2.2 then
    set in your environment:

        ANT_HOME=$PWD/jldap/ant
        JAVA_HOME=/usr/local/jdk1.2.2
        PATH="$ANT_HOME/bin:$PATH"
        export ANT_HOME JAVA_HOME PATH

To build everything just invoke ant as follows from the top of the source tree:

    ant all

Targets available at the top of the source tree are:
     clean   - Cleans all generated files and directories in this and
               subbordinate directories
     cleanpkg- Cleans pkg directory
     doc     - Builds javadoc files
     debug   - Builds debug classes and jar files
     release - Builds release classes and jar files
     lib     - Builds debug & release classes and jar files.
     jar     - Synonym for lib
     all     - Builds everything possible. It will build in all directories -
               debug and release jar files, java doc, samples, test programs,
               and create an installation directory called pkg.
     install - Copies build results from all directories and creates the
               pkg directory.
     pkg     - Synonym for install

Targets available int the the ldap and novp directories are:
     clean   - Cleans all generated files and directories in this
               and subbordinate directories
     doc     - Builds javadoc files
     debug   - Builds debug classes and jar files
     release - Builds release classes and jar files
     lib     - Builds debug & release classes and jar files
     jar     - Synonym for lib
     all     - Builds everything possible in this directory  It will build
               debug and release jar files, javadoc, samples, and test programs.

Targets available int the the diretories containing java files are:
     clean   - Cleans all generated class files
     compile - Builds debug classes and jar files
     all     - Synonym for compile


The following directories are created when "ant all" is run:

    Contents of directories in the ldap directory
        jldap/ldap/classes          /* Classes used to build lib/ldap.jar */
        jldap/ldap/classes_debug    /* Classes used to build lib_debug/ldap.jar */

        jldap/ldap/classes_samples  /* Classes for the sample programs */
        jldap/ldap/lib              /* Jar file for ldap - optimized, debug off */
        jldap/ldap/lib_debug        /* Jar file for ldap - not optimized, debug on */
        jldap/ldap/doc              /* Javadoc for ldap.jar classes */

    Contents of directories in the novbp directory
        jldap/novbp/classes         /* Classes used to build lib/novbp.jar */
