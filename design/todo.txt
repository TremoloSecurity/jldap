Java LDAP API Projects (not in any order)
---------------------
    Implement the sasl bind methods in LDAPConnection.

    IETF Draft 18 support.  Currently the code is somewhere close to draft
         17.  For the complete list of draft 18 changes, see
         the file jldap/design/todo-draft17.txt.

    Implement a generalized response factory for LDAP Extended responses.
       We need to implement the new register command for LDAPExtendedResponses. 
       Right now generation of LDAPExtendedResponse classes is hard coded in
       com/novell/ldap/client/ExtResponseFactory.java.

    Create Utility classes for reading and writing LDIF and/or DSML

    Add support for Extended Partial Response
    
Implementation Notes
--------------------

    The org.ietf.ldap package exposes only those classes and methods
    defined the the IETF Java LDAP API draft.  These classes are adapters
    to the com.novell.ldap classes.  We do not deprecate methods and
    classes eliminated by changes to the ITEF draft, we just remove them.

    The com.novell.ldap classes implement the functionality defined in
    the LDAP API draft as well as additional functionality we feel is
    useful.  Methods or classes that are removed by changes to the IETF
    draft are deprecated.

    Note: All enhancements and updates should include appropriate Javadoc.
