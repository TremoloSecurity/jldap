Java LDAP API development that needs to be done (not in any order)
---------------------
    - IETF Draft 18 support.  Currently the code is very close to draft 18.
      Functionality not yet implemented from draft 18:
         
        - Implementation of the LBURP Extended Request in JLDAP.
         
        - Implementation of the Event Notification Extended Request in JLDAP
        
        - Implemenation of JNDI Service provider for JLDAP.

        - Object Serialization. The following objects need to implement
          Serializable.
              LDAPAttribute 
              LDAPAttributeSet 
              LDAPConstraints 
              LDAPControl 
              LDAPEntry 
              LDAPExtendedOperation 
              LDAPExtendedResponse 
              LDAPMessage 
              LDAPModification 
              LDAPSchema 
              LDAPSchemaElement 
              LDAPUrl 
            
        - LDAPExtendedResponse.register method

          Implement a generalized response factory for LDAP Extended / Partial
          Responses.  This includes the implementation of the register
          method for the LDAPExtendedResponse class. In the current code,
          instantiation of LDAPExtendedResponse sub-classes is hard coded
          in the file com/novell/ldap/client/ExtResponseFactory.java.

    - Create Utility classes for reading and writing LDIF and/or DSML
            
      Design currently in progress for this item.

    - Add support for Extended Partial Response.
    
      Must be coordinated with LDAPExtendedResonse.register work above.

	- Add LDAP Password Modify extended operation support
	- Add LDAP Who Am I? extended operation support
	- Add LDAP Cancel extended operation support
	- Add LDAP Proxy Authorization control support
	- Add LDAP Assertion control support
	- Add LDAP Pre/Post Read control support
	- Add LDAP Matched Values control support
	- Add LDAP ManageDsaIT control support
	- Add LDAP Subentries control support
    
Implementation Notes
--------------------

    The org.ietf.ldap package exposes only those classes and methods
    defined the the IETF Java LDAP API draft.  These classes are adapters
    to the com.novell.ldap classes.  We do not deprecate methods and
    classes eliminated by changes to the ITEF draft, we just remove them.

    The com.novell.ldap classes implement the functionality defined in
    the LDAP API draft as well as additional functionality we feel is
    useful.  Methods or classes that are removed by changes to the IETF
    draft are deprecated.

    Note: All enhancements and updates should include appropriate Javadoc.
