    <display-name>DSML Web Service</display-name>
    <description>
    DSML Web Service to access eDirectory and other LDAP
    directories.  Two implementations are included:

    1.  dsml - Default service.  Built by Novell Extend product, JBrokerWeb,
    this service features more robust SOAP handling.  This leading edge release
    does not support HTTP authentication nor SOAP Authentication.

    2.  dsmlstreaming - Alternative sevice.  Built from a standard servlet, this
    service features HTTP authentication but not SOAP Authentication and less
    robust SOAP handling.  This implementation is an attempt to overcome
    scalability issues with the DSMLv2 Specification.
