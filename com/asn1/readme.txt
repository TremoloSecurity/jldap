This is a temporary directory.  This directory holds partial
implementation of ASN1 classes that have not yet been 
implemented.  These classes are not used anywhere else
in the SDK.  But we anticipate customers using our ASN1
SDK to ask for these classes.  These classes will be 
moved to the com.novell.ldap.asn1 package once implemented.

Note:  This location was chosen as everything else under 
com.novell gets compiled and jarred to the deliverable.
