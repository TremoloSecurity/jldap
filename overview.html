<b>Introduction</b>

</p>The LDAP class libraries are designed to provide powerful, yet simple,
access to LDAP directory services. This API defines both asynchronous and
synchronous interfaces to LDAP to suit a wide variety of
applications. This document gives a brief overview of the LDAP model,
then an overview of the constituents of the class library.
</p>

<b>Overview of the LDAP model</b>

<p>LDAP is the lightweight directory access protocol, described in RFC2251
and RFC2252. It defines a lightweight access mechanism in which clients
send requests to and receive responses from LDAP servers.</p>

<p>The LDAP information model comes from X.500 and is based on the
entry, which contains information about some object (e.g., a person).
Entries are composed of attributes, which have a type and one or more
values. Each attribute has a syntax that determines what kinds of
values are allowed in the attribute (e.g., ASCII characters, a jpeg
photograph, etc.) and how those values behave during directory
operations (e.g., is case significant during comparisons).</p>

<p>Entries may be organized in a tree structure, usually based on
political, geographical, and organizational boundaries. Other
structures are possible, including a flat namespace. Each entry is
uniquely named relative to its sibling entries by its relative
distinguished name (RDN) consisting of one or more distinguished
attribute values from the entry. At most one value from each
attribute may be used in the RDN. For example, the entry for the
person Babs Jensen might be named with the "Barbara Jensen" value
from the commonName attribute.</p>

<p>A globally unique name for an entry, called a distinguished name or
DN, is constructed by concatenating the sequence of RDNs from the
entry up to the root of the tree. For example, if Babs worked for the
University of Michigan, the DN of her U-M entry might be "cn=Barbara
Jensen, o=University of Michigan, c=US". The DN format used by LDAP
is defined in RFC2253.</p>

<p>Operations are provided to authenticate, search for and retrieve
information, modify information, and add and delete entries from the
tree.</p>

<p>An LDAP server may return referrals if it cannot completely service a
request (for example if the request specifies a directory base
outside of the tree managed by the server). The LDAP class library
offers the programmer three options: the programmer can catch these
referrals as exceptions and explicitly issue new requests to the
referred-to servers, the programmer can provide an object to
establish a new connection to a referred-to server, or the programmer
can let the library automatically follow the referrals.  In the
latter case, the programmer may also provide a reauthentication
object, allowing automatic referrals to proceed with appropriate
credentials. If no such object is provided, referrals are followed
with anonymous credentials, and the protocol level of the original
connection is used. If the original connection used a socket factory
or TLS, the referral connection will use the same.</p>

<p>Before the client encodes and sends a string value to a server, the
string values are converted from the Java 16-bit Unicode format to
UTF-8 format, which is the standard string encoding for LDAPv3
servers. The integrity of double-byte and other non-ASCII character
sets is fully preserved.</p>

<b>Overview of the LDAP classes</b>

<p>The central LDAP class is LDAPConnection. It provides methods to
establish an authenticated or anonymous connection to an LDAP server,
as well as methods to search for, modify, compare, and delete entries
in the directory.</p>

<p>The LDAPConnection class also provides fields for storing settings
that are specific to the LDAP session (such as limits on the number
of results returned or timeout limits). An LDAPConnection object can
be cloned, allowing objects to share a single network connection but
use different settings (using LDAPConstraints or
LDAPSearchConstraints).</p>

<p>A synchronous search conducted by an LDAPConnection object returns
results in an LDAPSearchResults object, which can be enumerated to
access the entries found. Each entry (represented by an LDAPEntry
object) provides access to the attributes (represented by
LDAPAttribute objects) returned for that entry. Each attribute can
produce the values found as byte arrays or as Strings.</p>

<b>The LDAP asynchronous methods</b>

<p>The LDAP protocol provides synchronous as well as asynchronous
directory access methods. All asynchronous methods return listener
objects (either LDAPResponseListener or LDAPSearchListener) and also
take a listener object as input. The listener is a message queue
associated with the request, and it is the responsibility of the
client to read messages out of the queue and process them.</p>

<p>Messages retrieved from an LDAPResponseListener are result objects
derived from LDAPResponse. Messages retrieved from an
LDAPSearchListener are either result objects derived from
LDAPResponse, search results, or search result references.</p>

<p>An asynchronous search conducted by an LDAPConnection object returns
results via the getResponse method of the LDAPSearchListener returned
by the search operation. The getResponse method typically returns an
LDAPSearchResult object which has a getEntry method that returns the
LDAPEntry that represents the search entry.</p>

<p>None of the ancillary asynchronous classes are intended to be
instantiated by a client, so they lack public constructors.</p>

<b>Overview of LDAP API Use</b>

<p>An application generally uses the LDAP API in four steps.

<li><p>Construct an LDAPConnection.  Initialize an LDAP session with a
directory server. The LDAPConnection.connect() call establishes
a handle to the session, allowing multiple sessions to be open
at once, on different instances of LDAPConnection.</p></li>

<li><p>Authenticate to the LDAP server with
LDAPConnection.bind().</p></li>

<li><p>Perform some LDAP operations and obtain some results.
The synchronous version of LDAPConnection.search() returns an
LDAPSearchResults which can be enumerated to access all entries
found. The asynchronous version of LDAPConnection.search()
returns an LDAPSearchListener, which is used to read the
results of the search. LDAPConnection.read() returns a single
entry.</p></li>

<li><p>Close the connection. The LDAPConnection.disconnect() call
closes the connection.</p></li>

<p>There are both synchronous and asynchronous versions of the LDAP
protocol operations in this API. Synchronous methods do
not return until the operation has completed.</p>

<p>Asynchronous methods take a listener parameter (either
LDAPResponseListener or LDAPSearchListener) and return a listener
object which is used to enumerate the responses from the server.  A
loop is typically used to read from the listener object, which blocks
until there is a response available, until the operation has
completed.</p>

</p>An LDAPResponseListener may be shared between operations, for
multiplexing the results. In this case, the object returned on one
operation is passed in to one or more other operations, rather than
passing in null.</p>

<p>For the asynchronous methods, exceptions are raised only for
connection errors. LDAP result messages are converted into
LDAPResponse objects which are to be checked by the client for errors
and referrals, whereas the synchronous methods throw an LDAPException
on result codes other than 0.</p>

<p>To facilitate user feedback during synchronous searches, intermediate
search results can be obtained before the entire search operation is
completed by specifying the number of entries to return at a time.
Standard Java Enumerations are used to parse synchronous search
results.</p>

<p>Errors result in the throwing of an LDAPException, with a specific
error code and context-specific textual information available.</p>

<p>If null is passed as the value of an LDAPConstraints or
LDAPSearchConstraints parameter to an operation, the default
constraints are used for that operation.</p>

<p>If null is passed as the value of a DN to an operation it is treated
as if it was the empty string.</p>

<p>The API doesn't distinguish between LDAP search continuation
references and LDAP referrals, presenting a unified interface to the
client for handling the two.</p>

<p>Implementations of the API MUST ensure that the LDAPConnection class
is thread-safe. Other classes and methods MAY be thread-safe and the
implementor MUST indicate which classes and methods are thread-safe.</p>
